This plugin does not create a dedicated "Slide" Custom Post Type. There are plenty of plugins in the WordPress repository for that purpose. I recommend [Meteor Slides](https://wordpress.org/plugins/meteor-slides/)

== Installation ==

You can download and install Arconix FlexSlider using the built in WordPress plugin installer. If you download the plugin manually, make sure the files are uploaded to `/wp-content/plugins/arconix-flexslider/`.

== Upgrade Notice ==

Upgrade normally via your WordPress admin -> Plugins panel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the slider?  =
* Place the Arconix - Flexslider widget in the desired widget area
* Use the shortcode `[ac-flexslider]` on a post, page or other area
* Place `<?php echo do_shortcode( "[ac-flexslider]" ); ?>` in the desired page template
	
= Is there any other documentation? =
* Visit the plugin's [Documentation](http://arcnx.co/afswiki) for setup and configuration information
* Tutorials on advanced plugin usage can be found at [Arconix Computers](http://arconixpc.com/tag/arconix-flexslider)

= The slider isn't styled properly =
With no 2 themes exactly alike, it's extremely difficult to style a plugin that seamlessly integrates without issue. That's why the plugin was made so flexible -- Tighter integration between your theme and the flexslider can be achieved by copying `includes/css/arconix-flexslider.css` to the root of your theme folder. The plugin will load that file instead, keeping your changes safe on upgrades.
	
= What script powers the slider? =
This plugin uses [Owl Carousel](http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/) slider. While this plugin doesn't currently have built-in support for all the options supported by Owl Carousel, knowledgeable users will be able to implement nearly any option they'd like.
	
= I want to change how the slider works =
Most changes can be achieved by copying `includes/js/arconix-flexslider.js` to the root of your theme folder and then making any modifications there. That file will be loaded in place of the plugin default and will keep your changes safe on upgrade.
	
= What is responsive design? =
Responsive design is in essence designing a website to cater to the dimensions of the user's device. It has become very popular with the proliferation of web-enabled smartphones and tablets.

= Do I need a responsive theme to use this plugin? =
Absolutely not. The slider will conform to the dimensions provided to it
	
= I need help, or I found a bug =

* Check out the WordPress [support forum](http://arcnx.co/afshelp) or the [Issues section on Github](http://arcnx.co/afsissues)
